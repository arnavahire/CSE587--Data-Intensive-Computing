# CSE587--Data-Intensive-Computing
This repository contains all the assignments that I performed during Data Intensive Computing course in Spring 2017.

***IMPORTANT NOTE***

1. The database.sqlite file for DIC_Lab2 was pretty large and couldn't be directly uploaded to Github. The file is now present in the compressed folder called 'database' inside DIC_Lab2 folder.

2.The Outputs for DIC_Lab4 and DIC_lab5 were too large and couldn't be uploaded directly to Github because of Github's file upload constraint of 100 MB. So the Outputs were compressed and they are now present in the 'Output.zip' compressed folder.
